Well... so I got myself set-up with a Github Pages page but I'm not so sure I like it. Or at least maybe the theme. Or maybe the whole thing. My goal here is to have some fun with web development and this seems overly simplified. 

I could perhaps try to upload one of my app's from Hack Reactor on here, but I'd much rather have a database that I do actually have to manage. What fun is a website if there's no database, AMMIRITE?!

However, I do suppose I could continue to utilize this for the next few sprints at Hack Reactor. I mean, it's not like I'll have time to do anything complicated until that's over (which is in like three weeks, I think?)
